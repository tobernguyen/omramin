# omramin

Sync blood pressure and weight measurements from _OMRON connect_ to _Garmin Connect_.

OMRON Connect utilizes two distinct API versions:

    API v1: Primarily used in the Asia/Pacific region
    API v2: Implemented in other global regions

Note: The current implementation has been tested mostly with API v1. Feedback and testing for API v2 integration are welcomed.  
For testing and development purposes, it is strongly recommended to use a secondary Garmin Connect account.

## Features

Supports weight and blood pressure measurements.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bugficks/omramin.git
cd omramin
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -Ue .
```

### Update

```
git pull
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -Ue .
```

## Usage

### Adding a device:

Adding a device requires the MAC address of the device.

#### Interactively:

To add a new OMRON device, ensure it's in pairing mode and run:

```sh
omramin add
```

#### By MAC address:

If MAC address is known run e.g.:

```sh
  omramin add -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
  omramin add -m 00:11:22:33:44:55 --category scale --name "My Scale" --user 3
```

#### How to find MAC address of BPM

0. Turn on the pairing mode of the device
1. Use Android App [nRF Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en_US)
2. Scan for BLE devices
3. Find device with "BLESmart_BPM" in the name
4. The MAC address is displayed in the second line "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

Then you can add the device with the following command:

Notice that **user number is really important** for the sync to work
```sh
omramin add -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --category BPM --name "My BPM" --user 2
```

### Synchronizing to Garmin Connect:

#### Set up the credentials for Garmin Connect and OMRON connect
Use the following command and follow the instructions:

```sh
omramin sync
```

To sync data from your OMRON device to Garmin Connect:

```sh
omramin sync --days 1
```

This will synchronize data for the today and yesterday. Adjust the --days parameter as needed.
